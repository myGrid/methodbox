<h3>MethodBox signup denied</h3>

<p>Hi <%= @name %>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in MethodBox.</p>

<p>Regrettably we are not able to accept your application at this time.

The reason for this could be that you did not provide us with enough information to distinguish between a valid request to use MethodBox and an automatically generated spam attempt.</p>

<p>Regards
