PubmedQueryTool
===============

A simple Ruby on Rails plugin to interface with the PubMed database through NCBI's entrez API.

Please note that it is up to the implementing application to adhere to NCBI's terms of use, which are as follows:


"Do not overload NCBI's systems. Users intending to send numerous queries and/or retrieve large numbers of records from Entrez should comply with the following:

    * Run retrieval scripts on weekends or between 9 pm and 5 am Eastern Time weekdays for any series of more than 100 requests.
    * Send E-utilities requests to http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, not the standard NCBI Web address.
    * Make no more than 3 requests every 1 second.
    * Use the URL parameter email, and tool for distributed software, so that we can track your project and contact you if there is a problem.
    * NCBI's Disclaimer and Copyright notice must be evident to users of your service.  NLM does not claim the copyright on the abstracts in PubMed; however, journal publishers or authors may. NLM provides no legal advice concerning distribution of copyrighted materials, consult your legal counsel."
